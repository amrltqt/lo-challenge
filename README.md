# Temperature Server

This is a simple temperature server made of django features in combination with graphene. This has been done for a challenge that have been proposed during an interview process. 

Before this challenge, I was not aware about graphene or graphql in general. It tooks some hours to adapt and understand the way it's mean to work. 

The most challenging thing is to adapt the technology for the subscription part of the protocol as it's not necessarily well handled by the package available actually (tested the latest graphene).
